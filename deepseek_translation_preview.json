    "Summary": "Test results show elevated NST# (immature neutrophils), while other blood cell parameters are within normal range. This result suggests possible mild reactive bone marrow hyperplasia, commonly seen in the early stages of inflammation or infection, but without significant elevation in total white blood cell count or other blood cell abnormalities. Further evaluation is needed in conjunction with clinical symptoms and other laboratory tests.",
    "Summary_1": "Possible mild reactive bone marrow hyperplasia, cannot rule out early infection.",
    "Interpretation": "Elevated NST# is usually related to the bone marrow's response to infection, inflammation, or other stress states. In the absence of significant WBC and NEU elevation, isolated NST# elevation may suggest early infection or inflammatory response, especially in the initial stage of bacterial infection, before the bone marrow has caused a significant increase in mature neutrophil count.

Further evaluation is needed in conjunction with clinical manifestations.",

    "Interpretation": "Elevated NSH# (immature neutrophils) usually indicates accelerated release of incompletely mature granulocytes from the bone marrow into peripheral blood under stress, commonly seen in acute infections (such as bacterial infections) or inflammatory responses. In the absence of abnormalities in other white blood cell counts (WBC) or other classified cells, this change may represent a mild or early infectious process, or compensatory bone marrow hyperplasia caused by local inflammation.

Further evaluation is needed in conjunction with clinical background.",
    "Summary_1": "Possible viral infection/pertussis, brucellosis, or syphilis.",
    "Interpretation": "Elevated ALY# is usually related to the compensatory response of the bone marrow to anemia, hemolysis, or chronic inflammation. Since other white blood cell classification indicators (such as neutrophils, lymphocytes, etc.) show no significant abnormalities, it suggests that acute infection or immune system disorder is not currently present. This abnormality may reflect the bone marrow's response to some underlying stimulus, such as recent recovery from iron deficiency anemia, chronic inflammatory stimulation, or mild hemolysis.
